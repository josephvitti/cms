Pre-compiled binaries for OSX, Linux, and Windows can be found in

bin/osx/
bin/linux/
bin/win/

To install the binaries, just place them somewhere in your $PATH (i.e. ~/bin/).

selscan depends on the pthread library, which should be available by default
in any build environment on a OSX/Linux system.  On Windows, I have had success
building selscan using pthreads-win32 (http://www.sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/)
and compiling in a MinGW environment (http://www.mingw.org/). I have provided
a compiled version of the pthreads-win32 library in lib/win32/.

selscan (1.0.3+) also depends on zlib (http://www.zlib.net/), which should be
available by default in OSX/Linux build environments.  On Windows, I have had
success compiling zlib in a MinGW environment (http://www.mingw.org/).  I have
provided a compiled version of zlib for win32 in lib/win32/.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make selscan 

The selscan binary will appear in the src/ directory when built.

The program norm depends on GNU GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). There shouldn't be 
a strict need to download and install these yourself, as I've provided pre-compiled static 
versions of GSL for OSX, Linux, and Windows in lib/osx/, lib/linux/, and lib/win32/.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make norm 

The norm binary will appear in the src/ directory when built.
